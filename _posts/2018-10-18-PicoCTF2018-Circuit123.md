## Circuit
In this python reverse challenge, we have a flag encoded in sha512 and we need to find the key thanks to a program which check the key before decrypting.
This check is the vulnerability.
The problem is that to verify the key, the function transform it into a binary number, reverse it, and used as a base for a "simulated circuit".
If the "result" of the circuit has the right value, the key is considered good.

This "right value", the circuit and the encrypted flag are in a file called map2.txt
Another file called map1.txt is provided to us with the right key to explore the decrypter.

Here's the code of the verify function.
x it's the key, chalbox it's the content of the file.

Chalbox is divided into:
Lenght (of the key in bit)
Gates, a list of logical gates (only or and xor)
check, the value that the gate should give as output

In line 8 the key is transformed into bit-sequence and reversed.
then for every gate, a new "bit" it's added to b[] which is a list containing every bit of the circuit.

in line 23 we can see that it checks if the last bit of the circuit has a specific value (check[0] is an index, check[1] is a boolean, both taken from the file).

## Ok, what's the point?

The key it's something like a 128-bit input for this simulated circuit, which has to provide a well know output (0 in the case of map2.txt).
We need to reverse the circuit to get what's the right key.

The file was too hard to read, so I used that verify function to make things easier.
Basically, I modify it a bit to make it print all the circuit:

A pice of output:

```
v[128]=1
v[129]=(v[0] XOR False) XOR (v[64] XOR False)
v[130]=(v[129] XOR False) XOR (v[128] XOR True)
v[131]=(v[64] XOR True) OR (v[128] XOR False)
v[132]=(v[0] XOR True) OR (v[128] XOR False)
...
v[1138]=(v[1122] XOR False) OR (v[1137] XOR False)
v[1139]=(v[1107] XOR False) OR (v[1138] XOR False)
v[1140]=(v[1076] XOR False) OR (v[1139] XOR False)
```

Remember that v[0:127] are the input of the circuit.
Debbugging we can also see that v[1140]^1 has to be == 1 (Line 25, since check[0] =1140 and check[1]=true for the map2.txt file).

Form this information we can deduce that v[1140]=0.
And now we should backtrack all the circuit.

##Z3 gets handy

I used a poorly written z3 script in order to do this.
First, I rewrote one last time the script, to make it print gates in z3 syntax.

Thanks to this output I made this simple z3 script:
link-to-the-script

which produce a badly formatted result, here is a pice:

(it basically says for every index the boolean value).

Scripting a bit to traduce that in bit (and reversing) we get
"10100101000110110111010001001010000101101110111001000110010101111001011011101111101000101010111101001110000110110011001011001101"
which is the key in binary

This was a nice first approach to z3 to me.
